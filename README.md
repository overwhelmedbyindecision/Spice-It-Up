# Spice It Up
A web page to help find diverse seasonal recipes.
<hr>

<strong>Purpose:</strong>

The purpose of Spice It Up is to allow our users to mix-up their routines and learn new recipes from different cultures. 
<hr>
<strong>Functionality:</strong>

On our homepage, users can click links to our random recipe page, holiday feature page and search page. 

On our Random recipe page users can generate a random recipe with our random recipe button. Using spoonacular api, users looking for anything new to try something different and interesting are presented with a random recipe result, if the first recipe doesn't interest them, they can click again to generate another.

On our holiday feature page, users are presented with a two week calendar of upcoming holidays generated with the Calenderific API. When a holiday matches one of Spoonaculars cultural endpoints, users can click on the spice it up button featured under the holiday, to find new things to try from a different culture. 

On our search page, users with dietary restrictions, or who have an idea of something they'd like to try, can use our modal search form to input keywords, our dropdown box to narrow their search with one of spoonacular cultural endpoints (Korean, Nordic, Mexican etc.), and narrow their search results by diet (Ketogenic, Gluten-Free, Vegetarian etc.) 

On all pages, users can navigate using our navigation bar (Desktop), and our Navigation dropdown burger (Mobile). Using bulma and css we were able to present users with a polished User Interface, making their transition from our site external recipe pages as seemless as possible.

<strong>Goals Accomplished:</strong>

Users are able to generate  external links to recipes using our random page, holiday page and search page, through use of the Calendarific and Spoonacular APIs, allowing them to spice up their routines, finding new recipes to try from all over the world.
